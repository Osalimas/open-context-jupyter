G. Chapman.)\\n\\\"Honk-honk!\\\"\\nCrabbed, miserly old vjared Dunn,\\nseated on the porch of his low one\\nstory house, bent his ear and listened\\nintently.\\n\\\"Ho-o-onk!\\\"\\nHis thin sour lips formed an ex\\npression of comprehension and satis\\nfaction. He smiled in an eerie way.\\n\\\"You beat 'em all, old bird!\\\" he\\nchuckled, \\\"and I get the credit for it.\\nMornin' neighbor,\\\" he bobbed to a\\npassing asquaintance \\\"mowing?\\\"\\n\\\"Meadow strip hay, yes.\\\"\\n\\\"Get it in afore Wednesday, then,\\\"\\nadvised Jared, with a wise look at the\\n\\\"Wet spell?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure thing, within- twenty-four\\nhours.\\nThe sky was clear and spotless, but\\nRufus Dawes quickened his step. If\\nthere was one weather-versed man in\\nBridgeton, it was Jared. He never\\nprophesied wrong. The almanac\\nmight err, the signal service quibble,\\nbut Jared never made a mistake.\\nHence, his neighbor hobbled off at an\\naccelerated pace to save his menaced\\nhay crop.\\nThen Jared Dunn, double-faced old\\nskeesicks that he was! ambled enjoy\\nably around to his extensive poulary\\nyard. It was with eyes of pride and\\nexultation that he viewed one partic\\nular fowl among the numerous. This\\n'was a gloriously streaked and crested\\ngoose. It was pacing about in a con\\nsequential way, as though aware of\\nthe extreme approbation of its own\\ner. It was still honking, but low and\\ncrooning, as though talking to itself.\\n\\\"Daily report, all the same, old\\nHonolulu!\\\" approved Jared. \\\"I\\nwouldn't care to part with you.\\\"\\nHonolulu was a bird of passage,\\nstroay domiciled in an alien land.\\nA wild jose of superior endurance\\nand flying ower, it had landed down\\nin the poultry yard among other more\\ncivilized fellows about a year previ\\nous. There was a jagged wound in\\nits neck and as Jared came to exam\\nine this, he found imbedded within it\\nthe broken off stone head of an ar\\nrow. It was by pure accident that this\\narrow had played an important part\\nin the fortunes of Jared. He chanced\\nto relate the incident to a college .pro\\nfessor, whose fad was archeology and\\n\\\"I Wouldn't Care to Part V.\\\"lh You.\\\"\\nkindred sciences. The professor took\\nan interest in the circumstance. The\\narrow head was one identified as used\\nby ah obscure tribe in the Sandwich\\nIslands. It was apparent, therefore,\\nthat Honolulu had winged a memor\\nable flight over land and sea thou\\nsands of miles, to domesticate itself\\nin an humble poultry yard in a\\nstrange land. The incident of the long\\nflight of the fowl, was published in\\nseveral scientific journals, the naina\\ni\\nJ\\n1rt\\\"?5?ifr -rt. \\\".

But last\\nnight, before a brilliant audience greeted by\\nAugustoRooso. Italian Ambassador, Washing*\\nton society listened with rapt attention to one\\nof the most remarkable Ftories ever told of the\\nlinking of archeology with the most practical\\nsort of colonial expansion, based upon the\\nphysical necessities of a growing people.\\nImperial Rome is coming to life anew In the\\nDark Continent. Out of the blazing African\\nsands the genius of Premier Benito Mussolini\\nend the tireless enthusiasm of Gov. Oen. italo\\nBalbo, Italy's famed air marshal, are bringing\\ncrops and inscriptions, olives, oil and classical\\nmonument*. And the story was brought to\\nWashington because a professor of Latin in\\nCleveland asked the Archeological Society of\\nWashington to sponsor a trip for him to the\\nvast new-old colonial empire of Tripoli and\\nCyrenaica, in Northern Africa.\\nYears ago, when \\u03a0 Duce was merely \\\"growing\\nup\\\" as the rebuilder of Italy's war-shattered\\nfortunes, he took a momentous oath to the\\narmy of Blaclcshirts he was leading upon Rome.\\nIt was a dramatic moment. Disillusioned and a\\nprey to fears for the future of their country and\\nthemselves, the war veterans were in a plastic\\nmood. Anything could happen. So when this\\nuntried leader stood forth to address them,\\nmuch more than the fate of Italy hung upon\\nbis words.\\nPARIS, Berlin, London, Washington all lis\\ntened. And not one of these capitals cor\\nrectly interpreted the epoch-making words\\u2014\\n\\\"I swear to lead our country once more in the\\npath of Its ancient greatness!\\\" The world\\nthought it meant only another fantastic dream\\nof conquest by arms until, as time passed and\\nthe genuinely constructive pattern of Musso\\nlini's policy began to declare itself visibly,\\nworld tension lessened and hope was established\\nIn the room of fear. What Mussolini meant by\\nhis prophecy was far greater and more substan\\ntial than any vision of armed conquest could\\nbe. Guided and inspired by the history of\\nRome's most brilliant period, he looked far into\\nthe future and planned to bring back by peace\\nful, constructive means a glory and a stability\\neven greater than that of the Imperial City of\\ncenturies ago, for his eye was set upon the pos\\nsibilities of Africa, the idea of Italy as a self\\nsustaining nation, and a Northern Africa fer\\ntile, productive, alive where it has long been\\ndead, and ministering not only to the material\\nwants of a strong and lusty nation of develop\\ning powers, but to its cultural and spiritual\\nneeds as well. How this ideal has been launched\\nsuccessfully and is already attracting the close\\nattention of the other nations was the story\\ngraphically presented through the courtesy of\\nAmbassador Rosso and of the Italian officials\\nIn Rome and Africa.\\nToo little attention has been given right along\\nsince Fascism has proved a force to be reck\\noned with, to the fact that Mussolini has shown\\nhimself to be the world's most acute student of\\nhistory. Every one who has read Roman his\\ntory with any degree of attention has a smat\\ntering of the facts. But it remained for II Duce\\nto perceive in those facts which others had\\nread end failed to heed the solution of the\\nproblems under which Italy of post-war days\\nwas groaning. He alone realized that history is\\nalways a continuing force, instead of a static\\nthing of interest only. He knew that the buried\\ncity of Leptis Magna, whose glories had been\\nlost under waves of desert sands for ages, at one\\ntime paid Rome a tribute of a million pounds\\nof olive oil each year. He recalled that the poet\\nHorace, when he wished to show how rich a\\nman was in his epoch, wrote that the fellow\\npossessed granaries in Libya. Could not Italy\\ndivert the unemployment and discontent of\\nthousands of its ardent subjects to these fertile\\nfields which were merely waiting the enthusi\\nastic cultivation of youth and energy? Would\\nnot such endeavor repay many fold all the effort\\nand anxiety required, by reclaiming the desert\\nand assuring Italy food for her hungry chil\\ndren for the years to come, and nourishing their\\nsouls also by bringing back the buried monu\\nments and records of former Roman greatness\\nIn her colonies?\\nThe thing was so obvious, so simple, so en\\ntirely possible if the co-operation of the people\\nJ ieu\\u00b7 of the native quarter of Tripoli from the castle. Balbo has given orders that the picturesqueness of this old section be\\npreserved and that no modern buildings be constructed there.\\nBY ARTHUR STANLEY RIGGS,\\nDirector, Archeological Society oj Washington.\\nwag assured, that nobody but genius could con\\nsider it. The Ont steps were expensive. No\\nIncome could be anticipated for a considerable\\ntime. But the goal Justified the struggle, and\\nItalian archeologiste began to dig Leptis Magna\\nout oi the sands that centuries had piled above\\nthis former metropolis. More archeologistt\\nrame; more excavations were undertaken. Lit\\ntle by little, not in & single city, but scattered\\njudiciously through the Italian domain, emi\\nnent scholars delved into the past. One of the\\nmost interesting and appropriate inscriptions\\nthey have dug up In Cyrene discloses the sig\\nnificant fact that during the great famine in\\nGreece, between the years 331 and 323 B.C.\\nthis ancient \\\"African Athens\\\" exported some\\n29,000 tons of cereals for the relief of the starv\\ning Greek cities of Cyrene's motherland. Here,\\nIndeed, as this inscription proves, were once\\nfertile fields waiting only the plow and the seed\\nand water to bring forth enough to make Italy\\nIndependent and secure.\\n\\\\i/TTH such facts as these in mind. Dr.\\n* ' Kenneth Scott, professor of Latin at West\\nern Reserve University, and long an ardent\\nstudent of Latinized Africa, went to Tripolitania\\nand Cyrenaica last Spring and Summer. At\\nthe request of the Archeological Society of\\nWashington, Ambassador Rosso and many\\nItalian scholars who are friends of the writer,\\ngave Prof. Scott unexampled opportunities for\\nthe most searching investigations and scrutiny\\nin the rejuvenated colonial empire in Northern\\nAfrica. It is a huge territory covering some\\n350,000 square miles and embracing the ancient\\nprovinces of Cyrenaica and Numidia as its\\nmost Important region. Today Libia Itaiiana\\nextends east and west between the 10th and\\n25th parallels of longitude, and, crossing the\\nTropic of Cancer, reaches south to about lat\\nitude 23 degrees north. Appropriately enough,\\nwhen the Italian archeologists began to exca\\nvate the theater at Sabratha, a ruined city of\\nancient times lying on the coast to the west\\nof Lepti's Magna, they brought to light the\\n\\u2014!\\n\\\"Tyche\\\" op Tort une\\\" of Sabratha clasptBf\\nhands with the goddess Roma in the presence\\nof Roman legionnaires. The scene represents\\na peace pact between the mighty Italian capital\\nand the African city. Its significance of friend\\nship is perhaps even keener today than when^\\u00b7\\nthe relief was sculptured. Today it occupies a\\nplace of honor in the governor general's palace.\\nSetting this before his audience with the\\nfullest detail, Prof. Scott emphasized the prac\\ntical values archeology has had more than once\\nIn Italian history, citing the dramatic moment,\\nwhen, \\\"in the darkest depths of the Middle\\nAges, Cola di Rienzo for a breathless moment\\nresuscitated the lifeless corpse of Rome with\\nhis magic appeal to the glorious past of the city\\non the Tiber\\\" through revealing to the people\\nthe ancient bronze tablet inscribed with the\\nLex Imperio Vespasiano. He showed his audi\\nence that the power to appoint emperors had\\nrested with the Senate and the Roman people.\\n\\\"Then archeology had a ringing message, and\\ntoday It brings again the same challenge,\\\" with\\nthe monuments and other evidences of Rome's\\\"*\\nAfrican past as inspiration and stimulus to a\\nrevived Italy in the guiding of the new Italian\\nState. It is fortunate that in Gen. Balbo. the\\nDuce has a lieutenant who is a most enthusias\\ntic Latinist, a firm believer In th< destiny ot\\nmodern Rome, and a man of boundless enthusi\\nasms who Is administering his tremendous\\nprovince in a spirit of liberalism which accords\\nthe scientist a place of high honor. For Balbo\\nhas made an astonishing practical use of the\\ntreasures the archeologlsts have found.\\nThe palace of the governor general of Trip\\nolitania and Cyrenaica, the sprawling, irregular\\nfortress-castle of ancient times guarding the\\ncity of Tripoli, juts boldly out into the clea\\u00bb\\nemerald of the sea. It could hardly be bettered\\nas an epitome of both the purpose and the\\nexecution of Balbo's remarkable plan. The\\npalace is famjliar to every schoolboy because\\nof the depredations of the Barbary corsairs\\nwho were severely mauled in 1815 by an Amer\\nican squadron which blockaded the pirate den.\\nThe city of Tripoli, perhaps the most pic\\nturesque and attractive on the whole north\\nAfrican Coast, lies between the vast orange\\nhued sand dunes. All along the water front\\nwave the ostrich-feather plumes of tufted\\npalms, beneath which bloom incredible banks\\nof brilliant flowers. As a setting for the official\\nheadquarters of the new government, nothing\\ncould be lovelier. Under the Roman eagles of\\n2,000 years ago, Libya was a rich land of\\nwaving grain fields, fat vineyards and vastf\\nolive groves. Mussolini saw that what had\\nbeen could again be, and he ordered modern\\nscience and art to perform the miracle of\\nthe transformation.\\n\\\\A/ASHINGTON knows the dashing young\\n\\\" * Balbo well, remembering his tremendous\\nfeat of flying here from Italy, SO it Was highly\\nintriguing to the very people who had wel\\ncomed his literal eagles of the air, to learn\\nthat he has again soared high, and with equal\\nsuccess in an entirely different medium: The\\nrealm of practical statesmanship. One of his\\nfirst tasks in adapting the old castle to the\\npurposes of an up-to-date administrative office.,\\nwas to make adroit use of the ancient works\\nof art throughout the province as a series of\\nsymbolic links connecting ancient Roman rule\\nin Libya with the modern Fascist domination.\\nThus the castle has been completely trans\\nformed and is today a museum of pricelea\\nrelics of the past, as well as the focus of tihak\\nContinued on Fourteenth Page\\nThe Duke of Aosta. commander of native troops who are mounted on camels.

Pil\\ngrims from the whole world have journeyed to\\nthe scene of these happenings, some to view the\\nactual site, the Mecca of Christianity; others\\nto investigate the lore and tradition in which\\nthe Holy Land is steeped.\\nForemost among this latter class of pilgrims\\nare those archeologists and learned men who\\nhave concentrated their efforts on unearthing\\nthe hidden secrets which will provide for\\nmodem generations some idea of the ancient\\ncivilizations which preceded the age of Christ\\nand throw new light on the days of the\\nprophets and apostles alike. This fascinating\\nwork has been carried on at various times for\\ncenturies, but it is only in comparatively\\nrecent years that really important discoveries\\nhave been made.\\nOn tliis subject few men can talk with\\ngreater authority than Dr. E. W. Masterman,\\nwho has spent 20 years of his life in the Holy\\nLand and has witnessed at first hand some of\\nthe amazing discoveries made by the spade of\\nthe excavator. In his office at the huge London\\nHospital, which ministers to the sick and the\\ndiseased of the East End districts of the great\\nmetropolis, he told me the story of some of\\nthese amazing finds which have led in certain\\ncases to the confirmation of statements in the\\nOld and New Testaments, and in others to the\\nrational explanation of hitherto incompre\\nhensible phenomena mentioned in biblical\\ntradition\\n11 TVER since the Crusades,\\u201d Dr. Masterman\\nEZ said, \\u2018\\u2018the civilized world has sought to\\nsolve the mysteries which surround Palestine,\\na country whose history is the history of the\\nChristian religion, whose name of the Holy\\nLand lends it a mythical glamour which attracts\\nto its shores men of all nations and all creeds.\\nArcheologists have made Palestine the object\\nof painstaking and concentrated study, and the\\nresults of some of the more important excava\\ntory works that have been carried out there\\nthrow new light on problems that have puzzled\\nChristianity for thousands of years.\\n\\u2018\\u201cThe work of archeologists in Palestine,\\u201d he\\ncontinued, \\u2018\\u2018is not carried on with the idea\\nof completely solving one or two biblical\\nallusions, or confirming or disproving facts, but\\nwith the broader aim of enabling people of\\ntoday to form an idea of the kind of civilization\\nwhich existed in the time of the great Israel\\nitish monarchies and the later Roman and\\nHebrew dynasties to try to ascertain the kind\\nof cities, houses and the modes and manner, of\\neveryday life of the people of the time of Christ\\nBind of preceding ages.\\n\\u201cIncidentally, there arises the matter of solv\\ning or at least seeking a reasonable solution of\\nthose topographical and geographical problems\\nwhich have perplexed students of the Bible\\nfor centuries. Many of these remain obscure\\neven today, despite the great work done by\\narcheologists of the different nations. Here I\\nmay mention that attracted to this great work\\nhere have been representatives of all nations,\\nboth Jew and Gentile, Catholic and Protestant,\\nand even those professing no religion but re\\ngarding the matter from a purely historic or\\nscientific standpoint.\\n\\\"The United States has contributed as much\\naa any country, and indeed more than most,\\nto our present knowledge of the history of the\\nland where Christianity was born, a knowledge\\ncarefully and painstakingly garnered by scores\\nof expeditions. In the case of all modern\\nexpeditions full notes and plains have been\\nmade, and these are continually being supple\\nmented and increased by detailed contemporary\\nobservations.\\n'\\u2022For example, today Harvard University, the\\nPalestine Exploration Fund, the Hebrew Uni\\nversity in Jerusalem and the British School\\nof Archeology in Jerusalem are allied in\\nexcavating the remains of the once famous and\\nImportant city of Samaria. The chief credit\\nfor the organization of the expedition lies with\\nProf. Lake of Harvard.\\n\\u201cMany important finds have resulted. Twenty\\nyears ago important excavations were carried\\nout there by Prof. Reisner, but recent dis\\ncoveries have carried the work forward a great\\ndeal. This city dates back to the Israelite\\nperiod, and the excavators have unearthed\\nsufficient evidence to prove the magnificence\\nand splendor of this mighty city of a bygone\\nThe artist D. MoreUis conception of Salome being felicitated by her mother after being atearded the head of John the Baptist.\\ncivilization. Palaces and churches and tombs\\nof the early Christians have been brought to\\nlight.\\n11 TRACES of successive dynasties are not\\nlacking, for Samaria had a checkered\\nhistory. Prom the time of its capture by the\\nAssyrians under Sargon about 722 B. C. to the\\ncoming of Alexander the Great, nearly 400\\nyears later, apparently it never ceased to be\\nan important City. It was captured and de\\nstroyed again in the second century B. C.,\\nwith the result that evidences of its history\\nabout that time are scarce, but during the\\nRoman period it regained something of its\\nformer glory.\\n\\u201cAfter the destruction of the Roman city\\na Christian community continued to live on\\nthis spot and recently we discovered, near the\\nruins of the palace of Herod the Great, the\\nremains of a Christian church whose existence\\nhad hitherto been entirely unsuspected. Prom\\nthe evidence it appears to have been a church\\ndedicated to John the Baptist and the de\\ncapitated head of St. John was treasured with\\nin its walls for many years as one of its\\ngreatest possessions.\\n\\u201cThe shrine found there has been alluded\\nto by early pilgrims to the Holy Land in the\\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth centuries,\\nwhose descriptions of the shrine enabled us to\\nidentify it with the one found in this newly\\ndiscovered church.\\n\\u201cWe discovered also a marvelous fresco\\ndepicting the beheading of St. John the Baptist.\\nInvestigation showed that this church had\\nbeen rebuilt and renovated at various times\\nby the Crusaders, by the Greeks and by the\\nLatins.\\n\\u201cAccording to tradition, the finding of the\\nhead was made clandestinely in circumstances\\nwhich, according to Prof. J. W. Crowfoot, are\\nnot likely to have been commemorated until\\nthe fame of the relic was noised abroad and\\nits authenticity firmly established. Both archeo\\nlogical evidences and literary tradition are\\nvague as to the actual date of these happen\\nings, but authoritative opinion places them\\nsomewhere about the fifth century A. D.\\n\\u201cThese discoveries have confirmed in a very\\nwonderful manner the mythical greatness of\\nthe Israelitish monarchs; for instance, in the\\nvindication of the character of Ahab, who.\\naccording to biblical allusions, was something\\nof a tyrant and always quarreling with the\\nprophets. These records show him to have been\\nindeed one of the greatest and most gracious\\nof the Israelite kings.\\n\\u201cIn addition to the discoveries at Samaria,\\nor Sebastia as it was called in later times,\\nrecent excavations have brought to light much\\nthat is new and confirmed ancient tradition\\nconcerning the walled city of Jericho. These\\nlatest efforts prove Jericho to have been a\\nmighty city when the Israelites overthrew it\\nand that it remained a deserted city for cen\\nturies afterward.\\n\\u201cThe destruction of the city walls in the\\nlate Bronze Age was followed by a great con\\nflagration. The fire marks are plainly trace\\nable in each home of the city that has been\\nexamined. In some cases the charred debris\\ndiscovered by the excavators was as much as\\ntwo feet thick. We found burned beams and\\npalm fiber thatch, apparently from the roofs.\\nIt is clear, too, from all the evidence that the\\ncity was burned while in active occupation,\\nabout 1400 or 1500 B. C.\\n\\u201cIt should be remembered that the excava\\ntions in Jericho were made possible by the\\ngenerosity of two public-spirited men, Sir\\nCharles Marston and the late Lord Melchett.\\nWere it not for the lack of funds, which has\\nalways been a handicap, much more important\\nwork could be undertaken, and who knows with\\nwhat astonishing results?\\u201d\\nDR. MASTERMAN referred also to other\\naspects of the work of exploration and\\nexcavation in Palestine\\u2014-notably to the mag\\nnificent accomplishments of that grand old\\nman of Palestine archeology, Sir Flinders\\nPetrie, whose unflagging efforts and tireless\\nindustry have contributed so much to modern\\nknowledge of the ancient civilization of the\\nHoly Land.\\nJust before his departure for Palestine, where\\nhe is even now engaged in further excavatory\\nwork, Sir Flinders Petrie described to me some\\nof the more interesting features of his work.\\nHe told how under the soil of one of the\\nnumerous mounds, or small hills which break\\nthe dull uniformity of the Southern Palestine\\ndesert, he had found traces of successive civi\\nlizations, each of which had erected a town\\nor city cm the site, and each of which in turn\\nhad vanished, leaving only a few ruined walls\\nand tombs to mark the scene of its former\\nsplendors.\\n11 IVILIZATTONS,\\u201d Dr. Masterman observe^\\n\\u201ccome into being, they flourish for a\\nwhile, then decline into inevitable decay. That\\nis what archeology teaches us again and again.\\nNone of them has survived, and even our\\npresent civilization will one day follow the\\nfootsteps of its predecessors and give place to\\nsomething different. It is a fascinating hobby\\nto speculate as to what our next civilization\\nwill be like\\u2014perhaps a civilization from the\\nEast where the world was cradled.\\u2019\\u2019\\nOne of the most amazing features of Pales\\ntinian exploration in recent years, however,\\nhas been undoubtedly the explanation put\\nforward by several authorities as to the marvels\\nand miracles associated by tradition and bibli\\ncal lore with the exodus of the Israelites from\\nEgypt under the divinely inspired guidance of\\ntheir leader, Moses.\\nForty years ago Prof. Sayre of Oxford wrote:\\n\\u201cThe exact site of the \\u2018Mount of God\\u2019 must be\\nleft for future explorers to discover.\\u201d Since\\nthen many travelers and explorers have tried\\nto locate the spot. Among them have been\\nsoldiers, statesmen, archeologists and British\\nsecret service agents.\\nProminent among them was Dr. Alois Musil\\nof Prague, but perhaps most famous among\\nthose who have trodden these paths across the\\ndesert to investigate the mystery of the \\u201cMount\\nof God\\u201d is the elusive Lawrence of Arabia,\\nwhose work during the war took him over this\\nterritory. He was followed by certain officers\\nof the British Army whose duties have in post\\nwar years been the maintenance of law and\\norder in these areas. More recently the Rev.\\nW. J. Phythian Adams. M. A.. D. S. O., M. C,\\nhas contributed the weight of his authority\\non this subject.\\nBroadly speaking, the theory now gaining\\nground is that the miraculous happenings\\nwhich befell the fleeing Israelites may be\\nexplained by the geographical features of the\\nland.\\n(Copyright. 1932.1\\n^ A sane of Jericho as it stands today.

DAVIS.\\nINGERPRINT science has a new role\\u2014>\\nhelping archeologists to solve mysteries\\nIt appears that potters shaping their\\nclay in a Bible town, in the days of\\nSamuel and Saul and on down to the\\ntime of Christ, left fingerprints on their wares.\\nThe potters died. The Bible town fell into\\nruins. The broken lamps and pitchers, stUl\\nfinger-marked, lay buried in debris.\\nAnd now. several thousand years later, these\\nfingerprints, newly discovered, are plain enough\\nfor an archeologist to use them as dependable\\nclues In reconstructing the town's history.\\nThus, at last, archeology has succeeded In\\nforcing fingerprint science to do its well known\\nkind of detective work on mysteries of the past.\\nFor some time it has been hoped that cele\\nbrated masters of Greek vase painting could be\\nidentified by their prints. There are finger\\nmarks on some of the vases by unknown Oreeks.\\nWhat is sought is a fingerprint on ft signed\\nvase. That could\\u2014with luck\\u2014be matched with\\nprints on some of the unsigned vases. But so\\nfar that quest has proved unsuccessful. All the\\nprints on the puzzle-vases have been discour\\nftgtngly different.\\nSuccess in adapting fingerprint methods to\\nBible explorations will renew the faith of arch\\u00e9\\nologie ts that modern fingerprint science can\\nidentify the ancient dead. Possibilities In this\\nfield may be far-reaching, for soft clay natural\\nly catches finger imprints, and clay was the\\nmain stuff of which the ancient world was\\nmade.\\nOut of lumps of pliable clay, the ancients\\nmanufactured not only household dishes, but\\nimages of Astarte and Baal, art vases, tablets\\non which to write, and many of their houses\\nand walls. There Is detective work ahead there\\nfor scientists with microscopes and training In\\nanalysis of fingerprint patterns.\\nTHE Bible town which has yielded the first\\nimportant fingerprint data is Mlzpah, fa\\nmous for its associations with many Bible char\\nacters.\\nSince 1\\u00b72\\u03b2, this lont-buried town has been\\nIn Bible ruins.\\nthe scene of repeated scientific encampments.\\nArab workers move about on the high mound,\\nshoveling away earth, clearing city walls, carry\\ning basket loads of archeological evidence down\\nto the expedition offices below.\\nThe leader of these excavations, which have\\nJust entered upon their fifth season, Is Dr. Wil\\nliam P. Bade, professor of Semitic literature\\nand languages at the Pacific School of Religion,\\nBerkeley, Calif. Hie exploration of Tell en\\nNasbeth, as the site le called on modern maps,\\nle one of the most complete pieces of digging la\\nPalestine archeology.\\nMl2pah was one of the Canaanlte cities that\\nJoshua's spies saw when they went out to judge\\nthe strength of foes In the Promised Land. The\\nawestruck spies said the cities were \\\"walled up\\nto heaven.\\\" Just a frightened exaggeration?\\nWell, Prof. Bade found the wall of Mlzpah. and\\nthat wall haa caused biblical scholars to revise\\ntheir respectful opinions of Canaanlte building\\nprowess.\\nMlzpah's wall, unearthed, stands over 1\\u03b2\\nfeet thick and 20 feet high. When the Israelites\\ncame to conquer Palestine, the wall must have\\nstood full 40 feet high. Nevertheless, the Israel\\nites took Mlzpah.\\nAt Mlzpah, later, Samuel sat by the great gate\\nand acted as Judge over the people. Prof. Bade's\\nexpedition found this gate, the finest that has\\nbeen discovered in Palestine.\\nAt Mlzpah, Saul was chosen king by the cast\\ning of sacred lots. The excavations have un\\nearthed foundations of a large building, which\\nmay well have been the temple where Saul\\nwas crowned.\\nAt Mlzpah later occurred a political murder\\nwhen Oedaliah, a new and unsuspicious gover\\nnor, invited Ishmael and his friends to a ban\\nquet, though Oedaliah bad been warned that\\nIshmael was his enemy. The banquet ended in\\nan uprising and Oedaliah and other victims\\nwere slain. Thirty bodies were cast Into a cis\\ntern, there at Mlzpah. Prof. Bade's explorations\\nrevealed a cistern mysteriously sealed over,\\nwhich seems to be this ancient tale of political\\nintrigue.\\n|AR handles stamped with letters MZP have\\n^ been found, helping to verify the site as\\nMlzpah of Bible fame; also an agate seal bear\\u00b7\\n\\u03b9 Ing the significant words, \\\"Belonging to Jaaza\\nnlah, servant of the king.\\\" Capt. Jaazaniah,\\naccording to Bible verses, went to Mlzpah to\\noffer fealty to the governor there.\\nThrough all these discoveries the excavators\\nhave industriously collected a great many pot\\ntery objects, brokeq and whole, used by people\\nof Mlzpah In three or four thousand years \\u03bft\\nancient history. One season the workmen car\\nried basket\\u00b7 of pottery from tombs, wells and\\ntrash deposits.\\nProf. Bade le alert to the value of modern\\naids in rediscovering the Bible world. That\\nthere was a settlement on the mound, long\\nago, he first deduced when he climbed the hill\\nand saw broken chips of pottery lying among\\nthe wheat and barley on the tilled surface.\\nBefore he decided to dig, however, he sought\\nevidence of the wall that would have sur\\nrounded a city of Importance.\\nFor this he needed a good airplane photo\\ngraph, which might show, even under a blanket\\nof earth, the faint shape of a once prominent\\nwall. The German government came to his\\naid with an enlargement of an aerial photo\\ngraph showing environs of Jerusalem. Satisfied\\nthat there was Indeed a wall. Prof. Bade set his\\nmen to work and within half an hour the\\ncorner tower of the wall of Mizpah bad been\\nstruck.\\nThey had not been digging long when the\\narcheologlst began to wonder about finger\\nprints. There were a good many prints on the\\nclay lamps, jugs and bowls. Prof. Bade set aside\\nthe ancient fingerprint records. He was re\\nsolved to study them when he got away from\\nthe crowded, busy days of digging.\\nBack In his laboratory in Berkeley, he called\\non August Vollmer, professor of police admin\\nistration at the University of California and\\nformer police chief of Berkeley.\\nw \\\"It Is no reflection on the character of\\nmembers of the venerable company of ancient\\npotters to say that we are taking their finger\\u00b7\\nprints with the aid of the criminal Identification\\nbureau of a California city.\\\"\\nBible scholar and criminologist, working to\\ngether, sorted out two kinds of prints in the\\nclay evidence before them.\\nOn large, two-handled Jars, the potters of\\nMizpah had sometimes deliberately left thumb\\nand fingerprints on the Jar handles. The pot\\nters, who by the way were probably women,\\ndid this as a trademaark, Prof. Bade concludes.\\nGood workmen of every age have been eager\\nto mark their own products.\\nThe other type of print looks unintentional.\\nThis type of mark occurs scattered over the sur\\nface of bowls and other objects, as If the finger\\nmarks had come there In the shaping of the\\nclay.\\nBy comparing fingerprints, Prof. Bade and\\nProf. VoUmer have been able In many instance\\u00b7\\nto identify the work of the same potter.\\nThe debris of a town like Mizpah lies in\\nlayers buried by successive builders. In Bible\\nGedaliah, the governor,\\ninvited Ishmael and hi\\u00bb\\nfriends to a banquet, al\\nthough Gedaliah had been\\nwarned that Ishmael tvas his enemy.\\nThe banquet ended in an uprising.and\\nGedaliah and other victims were slain.\\ndays each new set of inhabitants, after a fire,\\nwar or other calamity, would level off the\\nwreckage and build their new homes over the\\nruins.\\nThis fllling-in and levellng-off process often\\ndisturbed the lower layers of burled history.\\nProf. Bade explains. For that reason, ar\\nch\\u00e9ologie ts have trouble tracing the same layer\\nof occupation over a 12-acre site such as Mix\\npah represents. And that means doubt and\\nmuch argument over the age and interpret\\u00bb\\u00b7\\ntion of the historic features of the site.\\nWhen clay Jara found in different parts \\u00ab\\u03b2\\nthe mound bear the unmistakable finger marks\\nof the same person, that is good evidence foe\\nsettling arguments. Clay pitchers were fragile\\n\\u25a0tuff. They broke easily, got lost down well*,\\nand in general lasted no longer than our own\\neveryday breakfast sets. 80 the finger mark\\u00b7\\nof an Israelite potter on her work, wherever\\nIt turns up, show that those parts of the mound\\nbelong to the same era of city history.\\nFarmers Get Break\\nTHE fermera bave gotten s good break an\\n' around In the past two years. They have\\neeen their purchasing power Just about doubled\\nand both their taxes and their Interest pay\\u00b7*\\nmente reduced.\\nlfcxes on farms and fanning equipment have\\ndropped In the two-year period from $478,000,000\\nto $380,000,000 and Interest payment from\\n$698,000,000 to $519,000,000.\\nFigur\\u00e9e gathered by the Bureau of Agrlculto\\u00b7\\nral Economics show that the net Income on\\nthe farms has risen from $5,300,000,000 to\\n$7,200,000,000, a very nice increase when it is\\nconsidered that along with the rise In Income\\nthere was also a rise in operating costs.\\nOf course, along with the actual cash return\\non crops there went also the rental, proceisiae\\ntax and other benefit payments from the VM\\neml Government, which aided materially\\nraising the farm income.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[39;49;00m \u001b[39;49;00m\n",

I was\\nsomething I had done or some\\nthing Ihad not done who in\\nthunder can -tell aboufa woman ?\\nand I was penitent as' any Mecca-bound\\nMoslem. She sat stiff\\nand straighten the half-gloom of\\nthe crowded wagonette, and\\nwould not even talk of the\\nweather. For my part, I whistled\\nthe Viennese waltz she had al\\nways loved, in the hope of making\\nher sigh. Then I whistled the\\n\\\"Saffron Sue\\\" air which she 'de\\ntested, in the hope of rriaking her\\nrage. But Annette sal stiff and\\nstraight and cold like the statue\\nof Juho in the art gallery.\\nI stood that kind-of thing as\\nlong as any man who is not a\\nShoshone Indian or a Grecian\\narcheology professor could stand\\nit; then I reached for Annette's\\nlittle, pinkish hand. She moyed\\nit slightly, slowly backward. I\\nfollowed up the beautiful member\\narid- pressed three fingers close in\\nmy big, rough palm. There was\\nno answering pressure, but An\\n'nette did not withdraw her hand,\\nand she turned her fluffy,' straw\\ncolored coiffure halfway toward\\nme.\\nm and Annette sighed at last.\\nThe girl to the left of me fidget\\ned about, and Bobby Gates across\\nthe way told a boisterous story.\\nIt all .threw the heart-chords out\\nof tune for a-moment, so that An\\nnette moved slightly away. I\\nbad been too sudden you have\\no handle Annette like a dyddite\\nshell. I drew back myself and ad\\ndressed a remark to the driver\\\"\\nabout the worms getting Jhe to-\\nbacco crop. Then Annette slid\\nback toward me, arid there was\\njust enough light to see the small\\nhand assiime its old position\\n. \\\"Sweet I whispereoV'don't\\nmove away again. \\\"The very,\\ntingle of your hand thrills me like\\nan Edison battery, and I love you\\nforever.\\\" , ,\\nShe jerked suddenly away then,\\nand I could see that she was try\\ning to read my face in the gloom.\\nThe girl at my left squirmed\\nabout like a diamond-back rat\\ntler.' The driver turned and ask\\ned if I wanted to buy a good 3-year-ojd\\ngray mule. But I burn\\ned with love for Annette, and\\nwould not \\\"be denied. I reached\\nand drew her toward me. Some\\nhow she seemed to give in all a\\nonce and snuggle close it was\\never Annette's dear way.\\n\\\"Do you reaHy mean it, Dick?\\\"\\nshe whispered.\\n\\\"Wait until we get home and\\nI'll make affidavit,\\\" I assured her. v\\n\\\"I am going to kiss you.\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" she cried sdftly, so that\\nthe girl at my left started. \\\"Oh,\\\"\\ncontinued Annette, \\\"some prying\\nwretch would see you !\\\"\\n\\\"Love is the greatest thing in\\nworld, but it is invisible,\\\" I par\\nried. \\\"But they would hear'\\\" de\\nmurred Annette.\\n\\\"None of these paltry creatures\\nis attuned to such a pitch that he\\ncould catch the vibrations of sen\\ntiment,\\\" I answered. \\\"I think\\nI shall kiss you on the lips.\\\" -\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[39;49;00m \u001b[39;49;00m\n",

Haskir..\\nA translation of the oldest real estate '\\nmortgage in the world has just been j\\nmade for President Charles W. Mark\\nham of the Illinois Central railroad. The ,\\nancient brick upon which the mortgage I\\nwas recorded was taken a short time j\\nago from Nippur, near ancient Babylon, :\\nand is considered to be one of the most j\\ninteresting archeological finds ever made, j\\nThe brick is 2,243 years old and it is iiir ;\\nscribed with the terms of a mortgage :\\nupon an orchard in Babylon to secure a j\\nloan made by a family of banKei*3 who, j\\naccording to the inscription, financed all f\\nthe big business deals of that period, in- !\\neluding those made by royalty.\\nTo the average person archeology is a i\\ndry, uninteresting sciencc. having no )\\npresent-day interest. Tt>* discovery of\\nsome small record like this ancient mort- 1\\nsage indicator how thoroughly the life, j\\ncustoms and ha aits of the ancient races\\ncorresponded with our own. Archeology '\\nhas many practical sides. It furnishes;\\nthe real basis for all historical knowledge\\nof ancient times. 11 may also serve to I\\ngive hints to the modern inventor. It is!\\nwell known thai the ancients possessed j\\nconveniences differing vastly from our\\nown. The differences are riot always in I\\nour favor. The speed and ease with j\\nwhich horses were handled in olden times J\\nare well established facts. Consequently\\ntheir gearing and harness must have j\\nbeen well adapted to the purpose. A New j\\n\\\\ork horse owner recently paid a high!\\nprioe for a set of bridles of improved pat- J\\ntern guaranteed to control the horses\\nwithout injuring their tender mouths. A\\nfew months later he visited Pompeii.\\nAmong the articles recovered there by\\nthe archeologists were a number of\\nbridles of precisely the same pattern as\\nthose which had recently been patented\\nin the United States, and which he had j\\npurchased as quite the newest ideas in t\\nbridles.\\nt ntil recently the study of archeology I\\nhas been chiefly confined to the old i\\nworld. The greatest amount of excava- ?\\ntion has been made in Egypt, Greece, j\\nItaly and the Mediterranean, islands..\\nStudies iri Switzerland, England, Scot\\nland. France and other parts of Europe\\nare now revealing new facts about races ?\\nwhose existence had been absolutely un- i\\nknown. In America the study of :\\narcheology is yet in its beginning, but I\\nthe ancient cities of Central America, ;\\nMexico and the mountainous coast of j\\nSouth America are yielding up rich\\ntreasures showing the development of :\\nthe earlier peoples of the western con- !\\nt.nent. f\\n}\\n* *\\nThe building of one city upon the site j\\nof another has been a frequent occur- j\\nrence in many ;\\nCities Are Built parts of the\\non Sites of Others world' In vo!\\\" 1\\n. canic countries !\\nwhere a sudden eruption was likely to ,\\nsubmerge a city without warning, after\\nmanner of l'ompeii and Herculaneum,\\nsuch a procedure is more easily under- I\\nstood than in a region where the cities :\\n?ere not apt to be suddenly hidden i\\nfrom View. In England and other parts I\\nof Europe burled cities are not infre\\nquent. Within the last three months the i\\narcheological world has been especially\\ninterested in the uncovering of the an- '\\ncient city of Uriconium in Shropshire\\nI ricon:um was built by the Romans I\\nduring their occupancy of Britain. It\\nwas situated on one of the principal i\\nRoman roads and was undoubtedly an\\nimportant center of Roman-Britain life. ?\\nalthough it lias lain buried for centuries. :\\nThe excavators have now completed the\\ncircuit of the city, which measured about 1\\nthree miles and inclosed an area of 170 <\\ncolumns undf'r a rortico of six\\ncolumns, is being excavated now Harts\\nof two altars and some large nieces of\\nstatuary are being recovered f\\nu^n'Tlfe6 s'tr^Tio^'t ?TCo!\\ntraced back to a lengih of feet ThS\\nbuilding has many rooms' At least W\\n? had hypocausts or hot air heat\\ng apparatus, indicating that\\nways of heating were not unknown ^\\nalthough the Saxon* and\\nNormans, who followed them, had not\\nthe art, for their ancestral castles were\\n&Ve a\\nI roads. A large number of coins, ranging\\n| from 23 B. C. to 392 A. D.. indicate the\\n! period of this city's prosperity.\\n*\\n* #\\n; The archeological work done in the\\n!

Some\\nold ruins which have recently been un\\nearthed in Nebraska Indicate that can\\n, nibalism was practiced to a considerable\\n! degree. One old hut which was excavated\\nlast year under the inspection of Robert\\nF. Gilder, archeologist of the State Mu\\nseum of the University of Nebraska, was\\nfound to be a veritable charnel house.\\nThe floor was strewn with the bones of\\nwomen and children, while a broken pot\\nheld a number of rib bones which had\\nattained a color produced bv boiling. The\\npottery and other relics found in this hut\\nwere crude and yet showed a certain at\\ntempt at ornamentation. In Wisconsin,\\nNorth Dakota and several northwestern\\nstates archeological research is now be\\ning carried on under the auspices of the\\nstate historical societies, some archeologi\\ncal organizations or by private individ\\nuals.\\nThe greatest impetus for work in\\nAmerica is furnished by the School of\\nAmerican Archeology, incorporated in\\nJ 907. This school has administrative\\nheadquarters in the historic old Govern\\nor's Palace in Santa Fe, N. M. From\\nthere it directs investigations in the\\nAmerican field, and offers opportunity\\nfor training and field work to students.\\nExcavations and explorations are being\\nconducted under its direction in Arizona,\\nNew Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Central\\nAmerica.\\nThe work of American archeologlsts\\nis almost entirely due to the influence of\\nthe Archeological Institute of America,\\nwhich was founded in Boston about thirty\\nyears ago.

In certain respects they\\nare more alike than any two\\nother Latin American republics.\\nSituated, the one on the western, the\\nother on the eastern, portions of South\\nAmerica, they share the fate of being\\ninland countries with no direct\\naccess to the sea. with no coast\\nline. They have also in common the\\nfact that, having been warred upon by\\nneighbors, they have lost a great por\\ntion of their respective territories, the\\nvalor of their population proving of no\\navail. And because of these things it\\nshould be only natural for them to draw\\ntogether. That, however, has not been\\nthe case, as between them there is an I\\nold dispute, already half a century old. j\\nbearing on the possession of a vast ter\\nritory, El Chaco Boreal, that lies be\\ntween the two countries.\\nThe territory that Bolivia and Para\\nguay dispute embraces, according to\\nthe Bolivian internationalist Miguel\\nMercado, somewhat over 12.000 square\\nleagues. It is situated in the most fer\\ntile region of the southern continent, a\\nregion not unlike the Valley of the\\nEuphrates, and much larger.\\nChaco Boreal is three times larger\\nthan Portugal, five times the size of\\nBelgium and Switzerland together,\\nfour times as large as Denmark and\\nHolland taken as a unit, twice the size\\nof Uruguay, almost as large as the five\\nrepublics of Central America, and of\\n\\u00ab,n even size with Italy and Great Brit\\nain.

Asuncion, Paraguay's\\ncapital, and Its sides running along the\\nrivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo, which\\nare its natural boundaries. The Para\\nguay River divides it from Paraguay,\\nthe Pilcomayo from the Argentine Re\\npublic. As it slopes toward the Para\\nguay River Basin it is watered by many\\nan affluent of this large stream. Chief\\namong these is the southern arm of the\\nPilcomayo, navigable for some 250 kilo\\nmeters. as from the Paraguayan Fort\\nGen.

To\\nthis water system there must be added\\nthe large pools and long inlets formed\\non its western bank by the Paraguay\\nRiver when it floods.\\nRich in Soil and Forest.\\nIn. this territory a population of\\n30,000,000 could be at ease. It is an\\nimmense reservoir of resources. Mea\\n*erly populated now, it is none the less\\na powerful asset. The benignity of its\\nclimate, its natural irrigation facilities,\\nthe richness of its soil and subsoil, the\\nwealth of its virgin forest, thick woods,\\nmake of it a land of veritable promise\\nR>r the mankind that lives a stifled :\\nIne in an overcrowded world. j\\nBolivia\\u2019s grounds for claiming title to\\nthe territory involved are as follows: |\\nThe Audiencia of Charcas, which on\\nbecoming an independent country was\\ntransformed into the Republic of Bolivia,\\nwas founded by the Spanish conquerors\\nIn the sixteenth century as covering a\\nterritory of round proportions with its\\ncenter at Chuquisaca and extending cir\\ncularly for a hundred leagues (300\\nmiles) about this center.\\nBy Royal Charter (Cedula Real) of\\nAugust 29, 1563, His Magesty Philip II\\ngranted to the Audiencia de Charcas\\nthe lands that had been explored by\\nAndreas Marzo and Nunez de Chaves\\n\\\"together with whatever other lands\\nmay be settled in those parts.\\u201d It is\\nthis region, lying like a wedge between\\nthe Pilcomayo and Paraguay Rivers, \\u2022\\nthat Paraguay disputes Bolivia.\\nRuling by Monarch.\\nOn December 10 of the same year.\\n1563, the Spanish monarch definitely\\nruled that the entire Chaco region be\\nlonged to the Real Audiencia de\\nCharcas, fixing the boundaries of this\\ndominion of the Spanish crown on the\\nsouth by the entire course of the\\nPicomayo River and on the north by\\nthe lands of the Portuguese crown, now\\nBrazil. So that, w r hat now constitutes\\nParaguay proper as well as the disputed\\nterritory, were under the jurisdiction\\nand were judged to belong to the\\nAudiencia de Charcas.\\nFurther evidence is given by the fact\\n\\u2022hat by virtue of the royal charter of\\nOctober 1, 1566, the King denied au\\nthority to Commandant Francisco Ortiz\\nde Vergara to explore either Chaco or\\nGuaray (as what is now Paraguay was\\nthen called) based the royal action on\\nthe fact that these provinces were\\nalready under the domain of the\\nAudiencia de Charcas could not be\\nproper lands for exploration on which\\nto base claims looking forward to grants.\\nCharcas constituted an Immense\\ndomain. It soon became evident that\\nto kpep order within all its confines\\nwas a difficult matter. The revolt of\\nthe Indians presented a grave prob\\nlem. The Guaycuru and Payagua\\nIndians, now the republic of Paraguay,\\nwere especially restless and troublesome.\\nIn order to better defend that out\\nlying province of the Audiencia de\\nCharcas, Guayra was made into\\nGobemacion, or seat of government,\\nenjoying a certain measure of autonomy\\nIn order to better meet emergencies.\\nThe jurisdiction of this new govern\\nment did not extend at any time over\\nthe Chaco region, and a provision to\\nthis effect was definitely stipulated in\\nthe royal charter of December 16, 1617.\\nJurisdiction Assigned.\\nIn 1661 the Gobernacion de Guayra,\\nWhich comprised four cities, was re\\nleased from the jurisdiction of Charcas\\nand assigned under the Audipncia de\\nBuenos Aires. The province of Chaco,\\nthen a deserted region, remained under\\nthe jurisdiction of the Chuquisaca\\ngovernment as an integral part of the\\nAudiencia de Charcas. Among many\\nproofs of this fact it is pertinent to cite\\nIhe royal charter of December 17,\\n1743. wherein affirmed by royal author\\nity that \\u201cAll nations or portions there\\nof that are between the Philcomayo\\nand Paraguay Rivers extending beyond\\nthe community of Santa Cuz de la\\nSierra, do belong to Charcas.\\u201d This\\nregion described by the King is pre\\ncisely the land which Paraguay now\\nclaims.\\nBesides the innumerable documents\\nemanating from the Spanish crown,\\nwhich Bolivia presents in her defense,\\nthere exist also many opinions from\\npersonages of the time, the impartial\\nviews of authorative men, all of them\\nfavorable to Bolivia\\u2019s cause, among\\nwhich we make note herein of a few\\nof the most important ones.\\nDon Felix de Azara, a renowned his\\ntorian, cosmographer of fame and\\nlearned naturalist, was appointed by\\nH. M. Carlos 111 of Spain as commissar\\nto define the boundaries between the\\nSpanish and the Portuguese possessions\\nIn America. This illustrious savant re\\nmained nine and a half years in\\nParaguay, given entirely to his work,\\nAnd among his works he published a\\nmap in which the great Azara says:\\n\\\"The boundary of Paraguay to the\\nkest Is the same River Paraguay, it\\nRavine no possession in Chaco.\\u201d\\niiHhe work entitled \\u201cHia Voyages\\u201d\\n] by this authoritative writer, Azara as\\nj serts the following: \\u201cThe boundaries of\\nChaco are very broad, but despite its\\nnearness to Paraguay, this government\\ndoes not possess any portion in that\\nterritory.\\u201d And this was a true fact so\\nacknowledged that it was no obstacle\\nagainst the granting to Azara by the\\nmunicipal government of Asuncion, as\\na reward for the work mentioned, the\\ntitle of \\u201cIllustrious Paraguayan,\\u201d not\\nonly showing gratitude thereby, but\\nalso, as is quite evident, evincing its\\nconformity with what was stated in\\nthe learned book.\\nJuan Francisco de Aguirre, demar\\ncator of boundaries for the possessions\\nof Spain and Portugal in America, af\\nfirms in his diary that \\u201cthe jurisdiction\\nof Paraguay as a government extends\\n* * * to the west up to the settle\\nment of certain Spanish provinces, a\\nconsiderable extension of wild land,\\nwhich is the Great Chaco, the border of\\nwhich is the western bank of the Para\\nguay River.\\u201d\\nAnd it is well to bear in mind also\\nthe opinions to the same effect with\\nregard to the boundaries between Par\\naguay and Chaco, expressed with full\\nknowledge of the case by witnesses as\\ntrustworthy as Julio R. de Cesar, Cosme\\nBueno, Fray Inocencio Canete, Lidan y\\nCisneros, Father Guevara and Antonio\\nAlcedo. who in the course of centuries\\nhave had occasion to refer to the boun\\ndaries of the Province of Paraguay.\\nAudiencia Incorporated.\\nFinally, when Buenos Aires, by Royal\\ncharter of June 14. 1777, was constituted\\na Viceroyalty, the Audiencia de Charcas\\nwas incorporated therein as including\\nall the \\u201cCorregimientos\\u201d (districts\\nunder a Corregidor), townships and\\nterritories over which its jurisdiction\\nextended as from 1563, forming a single\\nundivided unit within the new colonial\\norganization. And as such a unit it\\nremained until 1810. When the proper\\narea of each new country formed from\\nthe former vast empire of Spain was con\\nsidered, by common consent of all the\\nnew States, the \\u201culti-possidetis juris\\u201d as\\nof 1810 was accepted as final basis. In\\nother words, each new country was to\\ncomprise the land which belonged to its\\ncolonial unit in 1810. In 1810 Chaco\\nwas an integral part and parcel of the\\nAudiencia of Charcas, and when the\\nAudiencia of Charcas was constituted\\nas the Republic of Bolivia by the uti\\npossidetis just explained, the new state\\nthat took for its name that of the great\\nliberator was conceived and exercising\\nits new sovereignty over Chaco. So\\nBolivians hold that the Chaco province\\nrightfully belongs to them.\\nParaguay\\u2019s side in the controversy Is\\nthus presented:\\n\\u201cOn the western side of the Paraguay\\nRiver extends a vast territory, several\\nthousand square miles, says President\\nGuggiari of Paraguay, this territory be\\ning. since colonial days, a part of the\\njurisdiction of the government of Asun\\ncion.\\u201d\\nExecutive Explains.\\nTo explain this, the Paraguayan Ex\\necutive adds: \\u201cAsuncion, as capital of\\nthe Province of Paraguay, was the most\\nimportant colonization nucleus of all\\ndistricts adjoining the river of the same\\nname. It was in Ascuncion, therefore,\\nthat the Spaniards concentrated their\\nefforts to dominate the neighboring\\nregions, including Gran Chaco. When\\nindependence was attained, the terri\\ntory of Gran Chaco naturally became a\\npart of the territorial estate of the new\\nRepublic of Paraguay, which inherited 1\\nthe Spanish Province of Paraguay.\\u201d <\\nAnd to prove it, Paraguayans adduce 1\\nthe arbitrational decision given out by \\u2019\\nPresident Hayes of the United States in\\n1870, deciding that the part of the\\nGran Chaco extending to the north of\\nAscuncion belonged solely to Paraguay,\\nand thus defeating the supposed rights\\nclaimed by the Argentine, government\\nover that territory.\\nBolivia inherited the Spanish prov\\nince of High Peru\\u2014states the Para\\nguayan viewpoint\\u2014adjoining the bor\\nder of Paraguay, precisely at the\\nnorthern edge of Gran Chaco. The\\nboundaries between the provinces had\\nnot been properly outlined. The ter\\nritorial boundaries of the colonial era\\nwere somewhat vague, and remained so\\nafter independence was gained. To\\neliminate this impression of uncertain\\nty Paraguay and Bolivia signed three\\nboundary treaties from 1879 to 1894,\\nwhich were not ratified later for sev\\neral reasons. In all three treaties,\\nParaguay and Bolivia referred to the\\nquestion as \\u201ca demarcation of boun\\ndaries.\\u201d It was never, in any sense,\\nconsidered a matter affecting the dom\\nination of Gran Chaco, whose Para\\nguayan ownership was never doubted.\\nSuch is the Paraguyan contention.\\nClaim Based on Possession.\\nEven though legal titles and historical\\ndocuments are the real grounds for the\\nBolivians claiming ownership to the\\nprovince in question, the Paraguayan\\nclaim is based on possession. Paraguay,\\nbecause of her proximity to the Chaco\\nterritory, her easy access and commu\\nnication with it and its adaptability to\\nher living conditions, established her\\nself in the Chaco province long before\\nthe Bolivians ever thought of asserting\\ntitle to it. The Paraguayans were the\\nfirst to explore and establish them\\nselves in it. They have, for the past\\ncentury, brought civilization to it.\\nThese are the principal reasons upon\\nwhich Paraguay bases her claim to the\\ndisputed territory. In addition to this,\\nin the course of the controversy and in\\nvarious treaties that have been signed,\\nBolivia to a certain extent recognized\\nParaguay\\u2019s possession of part of the\\nChaco province, and although none of\\nthese treaties is now in effect, this has\\nsufficed, according to the Paraguayan\\ncontention, to justify her claim of own\\nership over the territory under dispute.\\nLion Steak Popular\\nDish in London Cases\\nLion steak is now the most fashion\\nable dish in the exclusive London res\\ntaurants.

The guides then spread\\ni iheir sayings over Rome. About 90 per\\nj cent of all the tourists, be they from\\n; Prance, Germany, England or America.\\n, all say, or are said to have said, \\u201cYes.\\n: the Colosseum is weirdly beautiful, but\\n| how much more wonderful it would all\\nbe if only they had the same moon here\\nthat we have at home!\\u201d That is the\\n! true spirit, at all events, of what Is\\n! known popularly as the \\u201cpatriotic brag.\\u201d\\nj Many are the stories that arc current\\njof what Americans traveling abroad\\n! have said in exuberant praise of things\\nin this country. Perhaps the best one.\\nwith \\u201creverse English,\\u201d is that told of\\nthe German professor of geology who\\nvisited this country some years ago. He\\nwas shown many things and had them\\nexDlained to him fulsomely. But when\\ni he walked out from El Tovar to the edge\\nof the Grand Canyon, he lost his power\\nof expression for a time. When he could\\n! speak, he said, \\u201cWell, here is something\\nj that not even an American can\\n; exaggerate.\\u201d\\nBragging Called General.\\nNow we do not brag any more about\\nour things than foreigners do about\\ntheirs. It is only that most of us can\\nnot talk in his own language on equal\\n: terms with a foreigner. But those who\\n' can say that he talks just as much\\nabout money as we do, the only dif\\nference being that he talks of it in\\nsmaller denominations. He stresses the\\nscenery of his own country more than\\n; we ours, and when it comes to com\\ni ment on the superior cultural, historic\\n| and artistic glories which his country\\npossesses over that of any other, then,\\nreally, we cannot hold a candle to him.\\nPerhaps there is one stage more than\\ni others, however, from which we have\\n, allowed ourselves to be \\u201cbacked off\\n\\u2019 the boards.\\u201d That is the stage on\\nl which archeology has played its part.\\n! There is a reason for it. We came into\\n' the field of scientific archeology cen\\nturies later than did certain of the\\n1 European countries. Besides that, the\\nancient dead were much more numer\\nous in India, Mesopotamia and the\\n; Mediterranean area than they were\\nover here, and having had there a more\\nor less continued population more of\\nthe ancient monuments and artifacts\\n1 remained there than here.\\nBut the most pertinent fact is that\\nthe peoples who now live on the same\\nsites or in the same general localities\\nclaim to be, as they in some part are,\\nthe descendants of the earlier peoples\\nand the heirs of their civilizations. We\\ndo not claim to be either the de\\nscendants or the heirs of Western\\nHemisphere autochthons, because we\\ndo not yet know whether there were\\nany, or of Mayan, Aztec, Mound\\nbuilder or Indian aborigines. There\\nfore we have not an equal amount at\\nstake, and we have not had to de\\nfend atrocities, inhumanities, or even\\nthe peculiarities of our local forebears.\\nBegin to Study Indians.\\nWe have begun, however, to realize\\nthat there ore in this Western Hemi\\n- sphere antiquities of civilizations that\\n1 go back centuries farther than we had\\never supposed. It seems to have been\\n\\u00ab the Germans who first waked us up to\\n- the fact. It was nearly 75 years ago\\n> that their professors and students of\\nantiquity began to study the American\\nIndian.\\nThe splendid example of Indian\\nbasketry, pottery, weapons, artifacts\\nand skeletal remains which the Ger\\nmans obtained in this country and\\ntook back to Berlin and other places :\\ngave to Germany a museum of Amer- ;\\nican archeology better than anything j\\nthere was here. It took years of hard\\nwork before the scientists of the Smith\\nsonian Institution forged ahead with\\nthe collection which outranked all\\nothers.\\nAmerican archeology began here, as\\nmight be expected, gradually, acci\\ndentally, fortuitously. Our early col\\nonists tried rather to avoid the Indian\\narrow heads than to hunt for them.\\nBut, as the red man diminished in\\nnumbers before the white man, he\\ngained more than proportionately in\\nsentiment; or, to put it badly, as the\\nIndian gave up taking the scalp lock,\\nhe gained a halo. Arrow heads, as they\\nwere ploughed up, became the nucleus\\nof thousands of private collections,\\nmany of which have now been concen- j\\ntrated in local museums.\\nSpecimens in Many States.\\nThe mounds and earthworks In South\\nCarolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Wisconsin ;\\nand Minnesota became objects of arche- j\\nological and historical study and the I\\nthousands of bone, flint, shell, pearl, j\\nred sandstone, copper and polished j\\nstone artifacts of useful or ornamental\\nstyle were collected, compared, tabu\\nlated, published and localized.\\nThe pot holes in the rocks of the\\nSusquehanna, the marks on the walls\\nof caves in the Ozarks, the burials in\\nthe mounds of Southern Illinois, the\\nserpentine and other animal shapes of\\nlpw mounds in hundreds of Midwestern\\nlocalities came in for their share of\\nprivate, then local, then popular in\\nterest.\\nThe Spaniard overran Mexico and\\nPeru before we were ready to start west\\nof the Alleghenies. He seized all the\\ngold in sight, and even made long\\nmarches up into New Mexico and there\\nabouts, hunting for the fabled gold of\\nthe Seven Cities of Cibola. But he was\\n, worse off than Goethe, who walked in\\nRome, over the ancient Forum, without ;\\nknow ing it. , . .\\nThe Spaniard not only did not know' j\\nhe was marching over the graves and\\n! monuments of bvgone civilization, but\\n; he did not care. But now', we have\\n, begun to know it, and we care a great\\ndeal. It might easily be forgiven if we\\nbegan to \\u201ctalk much bigger\\u201d than we\\n, do about the splendid remains of the j\\nearly inhabitants of this hemisphere.. j\\nRich Finds In Mexico.\\nThere is plenty of room for pride in :\\nthe fine pyramids, the wonderful deco- ;\\nrative relief carvings, the artistic beauty>\\nof the turquoise mosaics; in the per- {\\nfeet naturalism of carved animal forms j\\nand the meticulous skill of the work\\nmen who made thousands of miniature |\\ngods and figurines in clay, stone and j\\ngold with which the culture sites of |\\nthe pre-Aztec Mayas in Yucatan and \\u25a0\\nGuatemala abound.\\nHere the fine work of late by Morley, l\\nMorris and others under the Carnegie j\\nInstitution of Washington should come j\\nin for more than a meed of praise. The\\nfour great tomes issued a few weeks ago\\nby the government of Mexico as its j\\ncontribution to the twenty-third In\\nternational Congress of Americanists {\\nwhich met in New York have illustra- j\\ntions of the monumental remains in 1\\nMexico that are nothing short of\\nastounding.\\nThere are prehistoric remains in\\nevery one of the states. In many states\\nthere are archeological societies which\\nhave helped to gather the local an\\ntiquities Into museums. It is, however,\\nin the Southwest that lie buried the\\ngreatest reservoirs of America\\u2019s pre\\nhistory. It was this dimly apprehended\\nfact that led the Archeological Insti\\ntute of America more than 20 years\\nago to found its School of American\\nArcheology at Santa Fe. in the heart\\nof the region of American antiquities.\\nFrom that school as a center, under\\nthe w'ise and able direction of Dr. Edgar\\nL. Hew'ett, now' also the head of the\\nDepartment of Archeology and An\\n! \\u2019hropology in the University of New\\nMexico, explorations have marked num\\n; berless future sites for work, and ex\\ncavations have laid bare many early\\npueblos In this work many of our\\nuniversities and schools have also en\\ngaged. among which the work of Har\\nvard and Phillips Andover particularly,\\nunder Kidder, and of the University of\\nMinnesota, deserve special mention.\\nThe most remarkable of the pre\\nhistoric cliff-dwelling sites in this coun\\ntry are in the side canyons of the\\nMancos River in Southwestern Colorado.\\nHundreds of these interesting villages\\nare inside the limits of the 49,126 acres\\nwhich have been set \\u00abside by the Gov\\nernment as the Mesa Verde National\\nPark. The names of Bandelier and\\nW. H. Holmes, for many years chief of\\nthe Bureau of Ethnology, are linked\\nforever with the early days of scientific\\nwork in the sites of the cliff dwellers.\\nThe other type of prehistoric sites,\\nwhich are many times more numerous\\nthan the cliff dwellings, is the pueblo,\\na large scale community tyouse. New\\nMexico and Arizona are full of them.\\nThey dot the tops of innumerable\\nmesas, they line the side valleys and\\ncanyons of the Rio Grande; there are\\nhundreds in the great Pajarito plateau\\non which Santa Fe is situated.\\nDate Back Centuries.\\nThe Hopi villages, Pueblo Bonito and\\nChettro Ketl in Chaco Canyon, Gran\\nQuivira and the Rito de los Frijoles. to\\nsingle some out of many, are the real\\nthings, and they date back centuries\\nbefore such tourist show places as Puye\\nand Taos.\\nThe same question arises In connec\\ntion with the excavation of ancien*\\nculture sites in our Southwest as did.\\nand to some extent still does, arise in\\nthe Mediterranean, Near and Far East\\nprehistoric centers. How old are they,\\nand how does one know?\\nThe protagonists of the Maya culture\\nin Yucatan now\\u2019 have certain dates that\\nreach back before the birth of Christ.\\nSo have the excavators in the pueblo\\nsites in New Mexico. The dates of the\\nformer are arrived at by the deciphering\\nof Maya chronological inscriptions;\\nthose of the latter by comparative\\nceramics.\\nIt has come to \\u2019 a the most widely\\nadmitted fact in arcneologicAl discovery\\nthat the finds of pottery, both whole\\nand in shreds, give the most exact\\nchronological yardstick that science\\nknows. It comes much closer in its\\nfigures than does geology, and It reaches\\nback centuries and millennia before\\nthere was writing of any kind.\\nExcavation in New Mexico.\\nAn account of a single excavation,\\nchoosing one out of many, ought to do\\nmore to explain and clarify the meth\\nods and results of a dig on United\\nStates soil than any amount of argu\\nment. By good chance such an exca\\nvation was conducted last Summer in\\nthe Mimbres Valley in Southwestern\\nNew Mexico. It was done by a joint\\nexpedition of the University of Minne\\nsota, under Prof. Albert E. Jenks. and\\nthe School of American Research at\\nSanta Fe. under Wesley Bradfield.\\nThat part of the work w\\u2019hich dealt\\nwith the chronological data from pot\\ntery w\\u2019as under the charge of Mr. Brad\\nfield, perhaps now the leading authori\\nty in this country on ceramic chro\\nnology.\\nThe School of American Research is\\nparticularly well equipped to do singly\\nor in a joint enterprise such an Ameri\\ncan excavation. Director Hewett Is the\\nbest all-around American archeologist\\nwe have, and he has also the necessary\\nknowledge of a comparative kind gained\\ni in actual work and surveys in the for\\neign fields of Mesopotamia, Palestine.\\nEgypt, Africa, Greece and Italy. In\\nKenneth M. Chapman the school at\\nSanta Fe has the best expert on the\\nart and decorative side of ceramics and\\nin Wesley Bradfield the leading au\\n! thority on chronological ceramic data,\\n! based on provenience, technique and\\nmaterial.\\nDig In Cameron Creek Area.\\nThe site dug last Summer in the\\nCameron Creek district of the Mimbres\\nValley is an extraordinary one. It Is\\nreniote enough to have remained vir\\ntually untouched, although from the\\nruins one can see Fort Bayard in the\\ndistance outlined in white against the\\nbase of the mountain range.\\nNaturally, the rooms nearest the sur\\nface were of the later periods. At first\\none might wonder why some of these\\nlater period surface rooms w\\u2019ere so\\nclearly marked out as ceremonial rooms,\\ncoming, as one likely would, from cliff\\ndwellings or pueblos where the cere\\nmonial klvas (or rooms) were under\\n| ground and at a lower level than the\\nliving rooms.\\nBut W\\u2019hen one is taken into an under\\nground pitroom where objects of a\\nI ceremonial character, that proved its\\nj use. were found, and is shown the\\nj prior, older entrance when that pit\\nj room was used as a living room, the\\n: transition from house to ceremonial\\nj use. as the levels of the pueblo rise, be\\ngins to grow clear.\\nCameron Creek, which runs through\\nthe Mimbres Valley, show's considerable\\nerosion below the recently excavated'\\npueblo. The south end of the pueblo\\nwas recognized by the thousands of\\nwall stones which had been carried\\naway by the creek when In flood. When\\nthe excavation began, it was found that\\nvirtually nothing remained of the sur\\nface houses except the foundations.\\nWhat had not been carried away by\\nthe water had been taken, after the\\nabandonment of the surface rooms, for\\nthe construction of other rooms toward\\nthe north.\\nDiscover Ancient Grave.\\nThere happened to be about 50 or\\nmore visitors the day the first pit\\n! burial w r as found. It was under the\\nj floor of a pitroom of the middle or\\n; early middle period of the pueblo. It\\nwas the grave of an adult woman. On\\nthe bone of her left arm above the\\nelbow w'ere four shell bracelets. Long\\nstrings of beads and two beautifully\\ncarved bracelets of shell came to light\\nat the bottom of the pit to the right\\no? the skull. Four broken bowls and\\nj pots were on the floor of the room at\\nthe right.\\nThe bowls were broken, as was ex\\n| pected. In the graves and tombs in\\nthe Mediterranean area the pottery\\n: buried with the dead is usually found\\n| unbroken. In the American pueblos,\\nj after the body was buried face down\\n| ward and in a contracted kneeling or\\ni crouching position, a large bowl was\\nj purposely broken down over the heat!\\nj and shoulders, and the other bowls, for\\n: the most part, were either broken or\\nhad a hole punched in tnem. It took\\n| nearly four hours to excavate the sma!\\u2019\\nI pit grave just described, because sh\\n[ fine gravel had to be scooped or duste'\\n' up very carefully and then every eup\\ni ful of it sifted;\\nAshes In Fire Pits.\\nThe second level was found about\\n7 feet below the surface. The room:\\n| were much deeper and the work ot\\nexcavation therefore, necessarily war\\n| much slower than in the surface rooms\\nSome of the hardest work was expe\\nrienced in clearing out the rooms a\\nthe south end of the West Hous:\\nmound. Most of July was passed ir\\nthis section of the pueblo. In one oi\\nthe latest used rooms the fire pits were\\nfoimd still full of ashes. The floor was\\ncovered with scattered pottery. The\\nstubs of the posts w\\u2019hich had been used\\nto hold up the roof were also brought\\nto light.\\nLate in July two of the students from\\nthe University of Minnesota were as\\nsigned to the excavation of a certain\\nroom which gave evidence of having\\nbeen an abandoned Btoreroom.

Abbot.\\nChief Justice Charles E. Hughes,\\nchancellor of the institution, and his\\nfellow regents were Informed of the\\ndetails of studies dealing with some of\\nthe basic problems of life on earth, of\\nexpeditions to little known parts of the\\nglobe in search of archeological, biologi\\ncal and geological material and of\\nrapidly Increasing museum collections\\nIn the service of American science.\\nAmong the problems to which special\\nattention has been devoted during the\\npast year. Secretary Abbot reported,\\nla that of the complicated relationship\\nbetween the carbon dioxide assimilation\\nof plants and the light intensity to\\nwhich they are exposed. This Is a\\nfundamental process In the organic\\nworld, a sort of dynamic corner stone\\nfor the whole structure of life.\\nWheat Plant Experiments.\\nThe experiments, it is reported, were\\nconducted with wheat plants grown in\\nliquid solutions, whose chemical con\\ntents of root food could be rigidly con\\ntrolled. The carbon dioxide assimila\\ntion of the wheat was measured for j\\nlight Intensities varying from 78 to\\n1.900 foot candles and for carbon dioxide\\nconcentrations varying from .004 to\\n.500 per cent.\\nThe Institution, Dr. Abbot reported,\\nsent out or participated in 25 expedi\\ntions in furtherance of its researches.\\nThese visited 13 States in the United\\nStates, several European countries,\\nCanada. Alaska, Mexico. Hispaniola,\\nJamaica, British Guinea and Southwest\\nAfrica. One was for the purpose of\\ncollecting rare minerals in the mines\\nof Mexico. Another sought to locate\\nthe highest, dryest spot in the Eastern\\nHemisphere for an astrophysical ob\\nservatory. another made a comprehen\\nsive study of the bird life of Hispaniola\\nand others made important archeologi\\ncal discoveries in the Far North.\\nAmong the more interesting additions\\nWere those made to the library. Out\\nstanding gifts were a set of 45 volumes\\nof a notable Buddhist work from the\\nKing of Siam and a volume dealing\\nwith Christopher Columbus from\\nForeign Minister Orandl of Italy.\\n157,870 Specimen\\u00b7 Added.\\nA total of 157,870 specimens was\\nadded to the collections of the National\\nMuseum, a governmentally supported\\nbranch of the institution. A large num\\nber of specimens v*ls examined and re\\nported upon, exchanged with other In\\nstitutions and given to schools. Collec\\ntions of general biological material\\nwere received from Siam and from\\nSouthwest Africa. Important accessions\\nIn archeology included collections of\\nantifacts from prehistoric sites in\\nEurope, native implements from Kodiak\\nIsland, customs and implements used\\nby the natives of Panama, and native\\npottery and textiles fron* Africa.\\nAn important series of plants came\\nfrom the Brazilian-Venezuelan frontier\\nand from Peru. The geological acces\\nsions Included a gold nugget weighing\\n81 troy ounces and important collec\\ntions of fossils, particularly of mam\\nmals. Important work in Oriental\\narcheology and art was carried on by\\nthe Freer Gallery of Art, under direc\\ntion of the Smithsonian.\\nAmong the significant Smithsonian\\nactivities were those dealing with the\\narcheology and ethnology of the\\nAmerican Indians, carried out by the\\n' Bureau of American Ethnology.\\nI NAVY ORDERS\\nLieut.

Arid archeol\\nogist. of the Freer Gallery under the\\nSmithsonian Institution, who was h're\\nthis, past week on his way to Europe,\\none of the Arst acts of th\\\" new Nation\\nalist government was thr creation of a\\nNational Research Institute. Though :\\nobseureo by the front-stage political j\\nand military activity in China. Dr Li\\nbelieves this act offers an important j\\nkev to the Quality of the new power\\nin his country It proves that the new\\nChina is abreast of the world\\nThe purpose of China\\u2019s National Re\\nsearch Institute.\\u2019' said Dr Li. \\\"is ex\\npressed in a phrase borrowed ft'om the j\\nSmithsonian Institution\\u2014the increase\\nand diffusion of knowledge. The insti- ;\\ntute has already organized an expe\\ndition to the province of Kwang Si to\\natudv the geology, paleontology, zoologv |\\nand botany of the province. The expe- 1\\ndition hopes also to include eventually\\nanthropology and archeology in its j\\n\\u2022rope.\\nSupport of Work.\\nThe cost of the expedition is shared\\nby the national government and the\\nprovincial government of Kwang Si\\nThe institute hopes in this way to d?- :\\nvelop systematic scientific exploration\\nof every province in China lam very\\nsure that the next 10 or 20 years will\\naee a revolution in the study of archeol\\nogy m my country and a great develop\\nment in all other sciences. All we need\\nis a stable government.''\\nThe membership of the National In\\natitute includes 30 outstanding scien\\ntists of China Dr. Li represents arch'\\u2019- j\\noiogy in the membership, and was the\\nfirst scientist appointed to the new or- J\\ngaruzation He will continue as Arid ;\\nrepresentative of the Smithsonian and j\\nthe Freer Gallery. In fact the Smith- j\\nlonian plans to co-operate actively with\\nthe new institute It is Dr. Li\\u2019s opinion\\nthat the new growth of national sell- ;\\nconsciousness has considerably bright - ,\\n*ned the outlook for foreign co-pperc- \\u25a0\\ntier, in scientific research in China.\\nScience in China.\\nIn sketching the history of modern j\\nscience in his country. Dr. Li said that\\nthe first national activity of importance\\nbegan with the founding of the Chinese j\\nRepublic in 1912. Shortly thereafter\\na science society was organized in this j\\ncountry to diffuse in China the scion- !\\ntific knowledge accumulated by the\\nWestern world. In 1920. a biologic? 1\\nlaboratory was established at Nanking,\\nand there is a movement on foot at -\\npresent to establish a second labors -\\nton- at Peking.\\nResearch of considerable importance\\nhas been done in the universities. At\\npresent, .all Chinese universities teach\\nnatural history intensively, and grad\\nutes of Chinese institutions have done\\nsuccessful post-graduate work in Amer\\nican universities. As a result of this\\n\\u2022ltuation the body of Chinese scholars\\ncapable of doing original scientific\\nWork is growing rapidly.\\nThe most productive native institu\\ntion. according to Dr Li. has been the ,\\nGeological Survey of China, organized\\nabout a dozen years ago. Its geologi- I\\neai paleontological, and archeological.\\nreports arc internationally known\\nInterest in Archeology.\\nDr Li points out that the reverence\\nto which the classics are held in his\\ncountry 7 naturally makes the subject of\\nnrcheotegy appeal to educated men.\\nIn 1923 a Swedish archeologist of\\nthe museum at Stockholm. Dr. J. S.\\nAnderssen, made discoveries which open\\na new chapter in Chinese aicheoiogy. f\\nIn the province* of Honan and Kansu,\\nhe unearthed bone and stone imple\\nments and pottery fragment* width!\\nrepresented a materiel culture unlike\\nanything that had been known from\\nChina before that time. The discov- j\\nerics bore considerable resemblance to]\\nfinds of prehistoric material made in\\nMesopotamia and in Persia, a feet j \\u25a0\\nwhich suggested that the various sec- j l\\nturns of the prehistoric world were not ]\\neo isolated as had been supposed Dr. j\\nAn&'-rssen anted th; period, in which\\nthe culture winch he uncovered had ex- j\\ntoted at about 3000 B C.\\nIn 1925 Dr. Li joined the Freer Gai\\nter- expedition to China which was \\\\\\nheaded by Carl Whiting Bishop and i \\u2018\\nundertook an archeological survey of 1\\nthe Feng River valley in Shansi Prov -\\nince Two prehistoric sites similar to t\\nexcavated by Dr. Anderssen were\\nfound and later investigated.\\nThe Smithsonian - Freer expedition -\\ntook patn& to itoUS tbt difficulties,\\nwhich peasant superstition places in the\\nway of excavation in China. In a coun\\ntry of ancestor worship ii is sacrilege }\\nto disturb the graves of the dead, of j\\ncourse.\\nWatched by Natives.\\nWhen we began excavating\\\" said\\nDr Li. \\\"gentry and peasants alike kept\\nconstant watch upon us They could\\nnot believe that we would work so hard\\nto collect piece* of broken pottery and\\nwere convinced that we were in search\\nes treasure of one serf or another\\n\\u201cOne day one of my most intelligent\\nworkmen came upon a human skeleton, j\\nWithout attracting the attention of ttu <\\nusual crowd of onlookers he notified j\\nme and I directed him to avoid uncov- j\\nering the skeleton. Had the peasantry\\nseen it they would have made serious I\\ntrouble fer us and I was worried to I\\nknow how we were going to avoid let- j\\ntmg them see it. Fortunately, the next j\\ndav rain came end kept the watchers j\\nindoor;, m that we were able to re- I\\nmove the skeleton unobserved.\\n\\u201cIt is still too soon to attempt reg\\nular excavation of old tombs In Chma.\\nA leng process of popular education\\nwill have to precede that At present\\nwe must restrict ourselves to villag\\nsites where there Is less chance of of\\nfending religious scruples \\u201c\\nHowever as Dr Li points out the j\\ndespoiling of tombs is common enough j\\nin China \\u2014not by archeologists, but\\nby vandals in pursuit of valuable !\\nbronze* and other works of art. which\\nforeigners purchase at fabulous price* j\\nMillions are involved in this traffic\\nwhich has done irreparable damage to j\\nthe most valuable record of China'*\\npge\\u2019 and which is proportionately dis- !\\nfinal* to stop.

Consequently, France's atti\\ntude will not parallel America's, nor\\nwill there be hasty recognition of a\\n, regime which, despite American sup\\nport, may be transitory.\\nAmerica's action in China is certainly j\\nthe big surprise of the week but there !\\nis another matter which also claims\\ncareful attention.\\nOn Monday Foreign Secretary Cham\\nberlain disclosed in the House of Com\\nmons. to the astonishment of the Quai\\nD\\u2019Orsay, the Franco-British disarma\\nment compromise, the text of which\\nhad been communicated to Washington\\nand other interested capitals.\\nThis document represents not so\\nmuch an agreement as a cessation of\\nthe disagreement last March at Geneva\\nIn It i\\u00ab discovered a trace ol Lord Cush\\nendun's proposal and the admiralty's\\nideas which the three-power confer\\nence had failed to ratify, namely the\\nreduction in tonnage of capital ships to\\n27.500. and of gun calibers from 16 to\\n13*2 inches On the other hand, cer\\ntain percentages adopted at Washing\\nton. which .seemed humiliating to\\nFrance, are discarded.\\nSecretary Kelloggs letter to Admiral\\nPbrter last February, proposing the\\nabolishment of submarines, finds par\\ntial satisfaction in limiting the number\\nof undersea craft exceeding 600 tons,\\nleaving the nations free to build small\\nsubmarines for coast defense,\\nBerlin Alarmed.\\nThus France has accepted the Brit\\nish admiralty's conception, while Great\\nBritain recognizes the validity of the\\nFrench general staff\\u2019s claims concern\\ning the reserve effectives in land armies\\nwhich had caused alarm in Berlin,\\ni It is true that this compromise might\\n| appear tit the general public more like\\ni a military and a naval entente than a\\ni step toward disarmament.

His\\nfirst year's itistrui'lion divirled itself\\ninto two parts, embodying, respective\\nly, general courses in Kuropean and\\nAmerican archeology. Jwring the first\\nsemester a class of even students be\\ngan its work with a brief glance at the\\ngeography of prehistoric Kuropc and\\nthe known evidence of the distribution\\nof eolithic, paleolithic, and neolithic\\nculture. Special attention was given\\nto ancient man and his problems in\\nKngland, France, Germany and Italy.\\nIn like manner the students gained a\\nworkable knowledge of ariy Kgyptian.\\nAssyrian, Cretian and Grecian culture,\\nthe latter being traced to the I'ersian\\ninvasion.\\n\\\"For the second half year Professor\\nCummings is centering attention upon\\nthe American field. That this phase of\\nthe subject is more interesting to\\nwestern students and that the first part\\nof the course gained considerable popu\\nlarity, is evident (rum the fact that\\nclass numbered twenty the second half.\\nThe geological history of the continent\\nwas briefly treated, before the Ameri\\ncan red race, with the several 'henries\\nof its origin, received consideration. In\\nstruction also covered the ethnology of\\nthe American tribes, especial emphasis\\nbeing laid upon those of the great\\nplateau regions of Arizona, New Mex\\nico, Utah and Colorado. Professor\\nCummings intends that the first year's\\ncourse in general Kuropean and Amer\\nican archeology will serve merely as a\\nfoundation for more advanced instruc\\ntion, and hopes, at the same time, that\\nIt will he recognized as a proper basis\\nfor the study of history and sociology.\\\"\\nThe above article calls attention to a\\ndeficiency that the university is trying\\nto correct. The law creating the uni\\nversity made it encumbent upon the\\nboard of regents to maintain a state\\nmuseum, yet at no time has there been\\nfinancial provision for its malnten\\nance. Probably no state in the union\\noffers greater oportunlties for a state\\nmuseum than does Arizona. Its anthro\\npological field cannot tie excelled: it\\nis the home of the Cliff Dwellers and\\naboriginal races; the work and Indus\\ntry of the Indians is probably more\\nclearly shown than in atiy other state.\\nWithin the university buildings are\\nthousands of interesting, unique and\\nrare museum exhibits, all boxed, how\\never, awaiting a proper place for their\\nexhibition.\\nThe work of Professor Cummings not\\nonly calls our attention to this need,\\nbut also to the work the other states\\nare doing, extracting specimens and ex\\nhibits from Arizona for their own\\nmuseums. Unless Arizona acts quick\\nly, the best from within the state will\\nbe lost.

A Diorama is not a flat picture. It is a minia\\nture stage set with a foreground and a background showing distance. This one shows a scene\\nin an Ohio city two thousand years ago. Have you ever heard of the Mound Builders? They\\nwere ancient races of American Indians. Their greatest civilizations had vanished before\\nColumbus discovered America. The state of Ohio contains some of the best examples of\\ntheir great mounds, with the richest treasures buried in them. And, although these man-made\\nhills are scattered across America, some of the ancient races are called \\u201cOhio Mound Build\\ners\\u201d because their style of building was first discovered in Ohio.\\nWhen you have finished this model, you will seem to be standing among these strange\\npeople. Behind them on hills are other parts of their walled city, and beyond that a great\\ntemple on a flat-topped mound, with rolling hills in the distance. There are really only three\\nparts to this Diorama\\u2014a FRAME or front of the model, the curving BACKGROUND, and\\nthe people in the city street.\\nTo make this easy model, use heavy wrapping paper to stiffen the cutout pieces. FIRST,\\ncut all the cutout pieces away from this page. It is easier to paste them down separately.\\nDON\\u2019T trim to outlines until later. Spread paste (with small cloth swab) evenly over a piece\\nof wrapping paper. Then lay one cutout piece on the pasted paper and put it under a weight\\n(such as magazines) to dry flat. Do this with all cutout pieces. Then, WHEN DRY, make\\nall inside cuts and slits and crease all dotted lines for folding. Now trim to exact outlines, and\\nfollow easy directions under STEP ONE, STEP TWO, etc.\\nK STEP ONE: When the\\n) white spaces have been cut\\n/ from inside the FRAME,\\nyou have part of a CITY\\nSTREET which folds\\n2 down on long dotted line. \\u00bb\\u25a0 ,\\n7 STREET WALL folds\\n| upward.

Some were massive fort walls miles in length.\\nSome were ceremonial \\\"effigy\\u201d mounds in the shapes of animals, birds and reptiles. Others were monuments to\\nthe dead. On flat-topped mounds huge temples were built containing kitchens for ceremonial feasts, rooms for\\npriests, ceremonial costumes, treasures, and sacred altar fires. Larger rooms held rows of the city\\u2019s dead, cov\\nered with stone or timber roofs. In time, each temple was burned and earth heaped over the ruins. Some of\\nthese mounds even today are over sixty feet high, their bases covering acres of land. From treasure* found In jjf\\nthem we know something of the life of these people two thousand years ago. Fortified cities with extensive \\u00ab\\ngardens contained thousands of inhabitants and many temples. Trade routes connected them with all points of the a\\ncompass. As there were no horses, trade goods were carried on the backs of men for thousands of mile* ||\\nThis Diorama shows traders in bright feathers from Mexico, obsidian from Yellowstone Park, mica from jj\\nNorth Carolina and copper from Lake Superior, being welcomed by a chief and his men ih a southern Ohio city,_ jf\\n| NEXT SUNDAY'S WORLD MUSEUM DIORAMA\\u2014-A DREAMER FINDS A NEW WORLD J :\\n\\u00bb \\u2022\\n*\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[39;49;00m \u001b[39;49;00m\n",

'i IE R E are three leading questions that everyone\\nwho makes a special study of archeology is\\ncalled upon to answer almost daily: First, how does\\nit happen that ancient cities in their entirety were\\ncovered with earth, forming sometimes veritable\\nhills of their own materials, and preserving their\\ntreasures of wealth and art until our days? Second,\\nhave not the ravages of time and the avarice of\\nman, and lately the spade of the\\nexcavator, already well nigh\\ndespoiled ancient sites? And\\nthird, where are the renowned\\ncities of the past that still he\\nunexplored? To answer these\\nquestions sufficiently and ex\\nhaustively would require a book:\\nbut I shall try to do what I\\ncan v.ithin the limits of a brief\\npaper.\\n1 he first question involves a\\ni ' nplicated answer, for the\\ni es that determined the decav\\nBy\\nGEORGE N. OLCO'\\n'rofessor of Roman Archeology. Columbia Universit\\nDrawings by H. C. Townsend\\nor fall of ancient cities were different in different\\ntimes and places. The unique example of Pompeii,\\nHerculaneum, and Stabiae is familiar to all. Three\\nflourishing towns, with the fertile farms and smiling\\nvillas about them, were overwhelmed in one night\\nby the awful river of lava and rain of ashes from\\nthe volcano; and since the recent eruption of\\nVesuvius and that of Mont Pelee we have been able\\nto study these phenomena in all their terrible reality.\\nBut such was not the lot of the hundreds and thou\\nsands of cities and towns of the ancient world.\\nHow then is it that they too were buried, not by a\\nsudden visitation of fate, but by the hand of man\\nor the slow, engulfing lapse of time?\\nConsider the turbulent conditions of ancient life.\\nWar was the spirit of the age,?-state against state\\nand city against city in implacable rivalry, until\\nRome by conquering all brought peace within the\\nboundaries of civilization The laws of early war\\nfare knew little of the sentiment of mercy; once a\\ncity was taken and sacked, its people, men, women,\\nand children, were sold into slavery or put to the\\nsword, its buildings and walls razed to the ground,\\nand, as if to preclude its ever rising from its ashes,\\nthe very site was plowed over and leveled with the\\nsurrounding plain. As Horace says:\\nProud cities by anger have come to their fall.\\nWalls and towers been razed by a fell demolition,\\nAnd the plow with its furrows lias covered them all.\\nThe Fate of Carthage\\nCUCH was the fate of Saguntum in Spain at the\\n^ hands of Hannibal in 218 B C., and such in turn\\nwas the terrible end of Carthage itself only seventy\\ntwo years afterward; and these are only two familiar\\nexamples out of hundreds. On both sites later\\ntowns arose, built over the old cities, with no attempt\\nto recover and utilize the earlier building materials;\\nand indeed this would not have repaid the trouble,\\nso complete had been the devastation. Of imperial\\nCarthage, the Romans did not leave one stone stand\\ning on another; and of Saguntum, Livy tells us\\nthat just before Hannibal made the final breach in\\nthe walls, the chief citizens, with the fell determina\\ntion of despair, gathered in a vast pile in the central\\nsquare gold and silver bullion, coin, vessels, and\\nstatues,?everything of value both public and\\n:y\\nprivate,?reduced the whole by tire to\\na mass of shapeless wreckage, and threw\\nthemselves into the seething flames. Yet,\\nhe says, \\\"The town was taken with\\nimmense booty. Though almost every\\nthing had been purposely destroyed by\\nthe citizens, and in the promiscuous\\nmassacre old and young alike had per\\nished. and what few captives were taken\\nalive became the booty of the soldiery,\\nnevertheless from the public auction of\\nwhat was left a large sum of money was\\nsecured, and much precious household\\nfurniture and clothing was sent to Car\\nthage \\\"\\nThe later towns disappeared in their\\ntime, and Roman Saguntum is repre\\n_____ sented to-day by some ruins known\\nIw I \\\" as Murviedro [Old Walls]; while of\\nRoman Carthage, the great metropolis\\nof the African Christian writers, only\\n______ meager remains are being gradually\\nbrought to light by the skilled researches\\nof Pere Delattre.\\nCitybuilt over city is the story of ancient\\nbarbarity. Xo less than nine distinct towns and\\nvillages have been found superposed on the hill of\\nHissarlik. the site of ancient Troy. It was far more\\nconvenient to throw down the dismantled walls and\\nlevel the place for a new community,?and who\\nwould delay such a work to dig into the rubbish\\nunderneath in the possibility of finding hidden\\ntreasure? Thus town after town on Hissarlik hill\\narose on the ruins of its predecessor, and Alexander\\nthe Great visited there the wretched village of his\\nday in a spirit of reverence for the legend of Priam\\nand Hector; but the finding of the great silver\\ntreasure near the Scsean Gate was reserved for Dr.\\nSchlieinann and modern scholarship.\\nBut not even the violence of warfare can account\\nfor the burial of most ancient cities. A still more\\nactive cause may be found, curiously enough, in\\nthe growth of the cities themselves, or in circum\\nstances due to a shifting of population, or a change\\nof rulers, or even to the adoption of a new religion.\\nTo us of modern times this must seem decidedly\\nstrange; but it is a fact none the less. In our cities,\\nwhere we construct a new building on the site of an\\nold one, we are careful to remove the debris and\\nbuild on bedrock, or at least on the old level. We\\nseek to cut down hills, and traffic requires a broad,\\nsmooth surface for our streets.\\nBut in ancient times such was not the case, or\\nrather it was a rule that operated to a less degree;\\nand even when it did operate, as in Rome, it pro\\nduced iust the result I am describing In the earlier\\ndays, when commerce was secondary to war. the\\nmost inaccessible sites were chosen for towns, that\\nthey might be defended more easily. That is why\\nTroy arose on the hill of Hissarlik. and Rome on\\nthe Palatine; and even where growing commerce\\nand civilization spread the town over the plain, its\\nsacred and public buildings remained perched on\\nthe inaccessible hill, its original seat, as in the case\\nof the Acropolis at Athens and the Acrocorinthus.\\nWho can travel in Italy to-day without wondering\\nat the small towns of Tuscany and Umbria, set so\\nhigh on the mountain tops that the peasants must\\nlose an hour or two a day in getting down to their\\nwork in the fields and back to bed at night ? These\\nare survivals of the age of war. Little Palatine\\nRome of the eighth century before our era was a\\nsettlement of shepherds, who\\ndrove their flocks down in the\\nmorning to browse in the plains,\\nand barricaded themselves at\\nnight in their highland fortress.\\nOld Buildings as Foundations\\n\\\"QUT when Rome grew into a\\ncity and spread over the sev\\nen hills and the intervening\\nvalleys, the very isolation of the\\nhills which had been a source\\nof safety and defense became\\nan obstacle to progress.

Persian in name, these\\nrare objects show descent from the\\npotter's last art of the vanished civiliza\\ntions of the ancient East.\\nSpecimens of Rare Design.\\nAffected by long burial in the earth\\nVrhich brings out a lovely iridescence,\\nDr. Hough said, these pottery speci\\nmens are of rare interest to th? arche\\nologist. Since the earliest time, precious\\nmetals and especially the luster of the\\nhighly prized copper cf the dim and\\ndusty past, have been used for deco\\nrative purposes. This collection, to the\\nextent of two or three sizable bowls.\\nDr. Hough explained, displays the skill\\nof the ancients in applying the copper\\nluster by a process of painting and\\nfiring.\\nSome of the pieces, deep bowls with\\none small foot, after the Chinese\\nfashion, are distinctive In type since\\nthey represent a special stage of\\nprogress in the evolution of pottery.\\nEarly in the ninth century, the skill\\nattained by the Chinese in making this\\ntype of pottery vessels aroused the\\nspirit of rivalry in the Persians. As a\\nresult their ruler sent special messen\\ngers to the Chinese Government ask\\ning for trained artisans to teach the\\nPersian subjects Chinese methods. The\\njoint artistic efforts of these two nations\\nresulted in a blending of Chinese form\\nand technique with Persian workman\\nship, culminating in a unique type of\\nth? art. This Chinese-Persian culture\\nreached the height of its development\\nearly in the twelfth century.\\nPersian Rivalry In 9th Century..\\nDuring the latter half of the ninth\\ncentury, the Persian spirit of rivalry\\nwas likewise aroused by the talent ex\\nhibited by the neighboring Armenians\\nin producing bright colors for pottery\\ndecoration. The secret of making\\nbright reds and blues was for centuries\\nknown only to the Armenians. The\\nPersian desire to acquire this knowl\\nedge finally grew so acute that the\\nPersian ruler, Shah Abbaz, forced the\\nArmenians to labor in Persian work\\nshops and to produce their native art\\nas a Persian product. Although resent\\nful, the Armenians yielded the secret\\nof their art. it is said, due to the\\ndiplomacy of Shah Abbaz, who after\\nthe fashion of Haroun-al-Raschid\\nmingled wdth them in disguise. He\\nvisited the workshops dressed as a\\npeasant, consoling the Armenians with\\nkindly conversation as well as honoring\\nthem with his presence at their places\\nof worship and even feasting them.\\nThus, gaining the admiration and con\\nfidence of the Armenian people, Shah\\nAbbaz likewise obtained the secret of\\nproducing bright colors, especially the\\ncobalt blue, which to the present time\\nIs popularly accredited to Persian\\ntalent.\\nBowl Held Choicest Specimen.\\nA bowl 8 Inches In diameter and 4\\ninches deep, decorated with flowing de\\nsigns of cobalt blue, reminding one of\\nthe graceful traceries or the art of the\\nanciqit East, is considered by Dr.\\nHough as the choicest specimen in the\\ncollection.\\nThe acquisition of this material from\\ntl \\u25a0 Calusd art collection of this city\\nwas made possible by the aid of the\\nBruce Hughes Archeological Fund.\\nDerailment Is Investigated.\\nMEXICO CITY, October 4 OP).\\u2014Sev\\neral detectives were sent yesterday to\\nAguae Calient* to Investigate the de\\nrailment near there Thursday of a pas\\nenger train bound for Mexico City.\\nThe accident was caused by the re\\nmoval of a section of rail from the\\ntrack.
