{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Week 6 Exercise 2"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook is derived from Eric Kansa's found here (https://github.com/ekansa/open-context-jupyter). This is going to demonstrate how to access Open Context's API and introduce you to data structures we haven't really encountered. You'll be returning a JSON with this activity, a format that is language-neutral and is great for dealing with data structured in a nested, hierarchical way. This API is accessed with Python, a programming language we haven't really used. Luckily, all you'll have to do is copy and paste the code - but as you're copy and pasting, remember to actually inspect the code and try to see if you can understand what each part of the code is doing. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When using this notebook, you'll see text instructions like our typical exercises. We'll use the benefit of Jupyter notebooks to interserpse code into these instructions, and you'll be able to do the activity right here! When you want to add a code, remember to just click on the + symbol in the toolbar above - this will start a new line (which will default to code). "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. First thing we'll do is make the Request module available. This will allows us to send HTTP requests using Python.\n\n`import requests`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2. Then we'll create a variable called \"api_search_url\" and give it a value. Note that the value we're using is the Open Context search, returning a JSON. \n\n`api_search_url = 'https://opencontext.org/search/.json?'`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"3. Now we'll create a dictionary in Python - these are unordered data values that are formatted in key:value pairs. In this case, we are creating a parameter for the Open Context search to just Roman data. \n\nparams = {\n        'q': 'roman' \n    \n}\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"4. We can check to make sure we got the dictionary right. \n\n`params`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"5. We will now create a variable that stores the request to the Open Context API with the parameters we've set up\n\n`response = requests.get(api_search_url, params=params)`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"6. This next command shows us the url that is sent to the API\n\n`print('Here\\'s the formatted url that gets sent to the Open Context API:\\n{}\\n'.format(response.url))`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"7. And this command checks the status code of the response to make sure no errors occurred. \n\n`if response.status_code == requests.codes.ok:\n    print('All ok')\nelif response.status_code == 403:\n    print('There was an authentication error. Did you paste your API above?')\nelse:\n    print('There was a problem. Error code: {}'.format(response.status_code))\n    print('Try running this cell again.')`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"8. To get the API's JSON results (what we asked it to grab), we'll create a variable called \"data.\" Then see what the JSON data looks like. \n\n`data = response.json()`\n\n`data`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"9. To make the JSON data easier to read, we'll add some color and indent some of the text. First we need to bring in the Pygments library. \n\n`import json`\n\n`from pygments import highlight, lexers, formatters`\n\nThen indent the text. \n\n`formatted_data = json.dumps(data, indent=2)`\n\nThen color the text. \n\n`highlighted_data = highlight(formatted_data, lexers.JsonLexer(), formatters.TerminalFormatter())`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"10. Now display the new JSON data. \n\n`print(highlighted_data)`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"11. Finally, export the JSON to as a file. \n\n`import json`\n\n`with open('OCromandata.json', 'w') as outfile:\njson.dump(data, outfile)`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"12. The last things to do are to save this notebook and download it onto your local machine, including your NAME in the filename. Then download the JSON file you just created. Upload both files to your forked repo for this exercise.
